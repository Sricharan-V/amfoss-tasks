## Why must we choose you?  
I am Sricharan from Amaravati Branch, I am experienced in coding, I started learning c from the month of August and I think I am considerably good at it, I reached division 3 (2 stars) in 3 weeks. I am a fast learner and i started doing ppython too and a bit of css, html, and java. I think I would be of great help to the club.  
## What is your plan for the next 6 months  
I am planning to learn as many languages in the 6 months of my first year excluding the preparation for labs and exams. My main goal is to learn to make a frontend wih backend, With the help of task 8 I was able to understand a bit of font-end and with the help of task-4 i understood a bit of backend.  
## How would you contribute back to the club  
I will make sure there are no mistakes from my side and I will try my best not to bother my seniors from the club and try to solve my own problems unless theyre severe, and after I am a senior I will help my juniors in their works and try to encourage them to do more for the club
