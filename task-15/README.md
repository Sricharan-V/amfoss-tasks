This task was very interesting, I've heard about project euler befor but I never tried it because I was not confident about myself, but I tried it this time and surprisingly the first question went pretty well, i trried other questions too. 4th question was kind of tough for me, i tried it in multiple ways, and had some mistakes in the palindrome function's return value and I learned a few things(do's and dont's), I tried it in a different approach as to make the executing time low but it didn't work and I did it in a longer(time taking) method and I didnt get a time complexity error so I guess I was lucky over there. Yeah and task was very fun.
